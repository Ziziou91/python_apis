# APIS

API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are a helpful way for different software applications to talk to 
each other and exchange information. Similar to how a user interacts with an interfaces with buttons and menus to 
interact with software, applications use APIs to interact with each other.

## Example
![Simple API example](./Images/how-api-works.jpg)
Imagine you have two systems: System 1 and System 2. System 1 needs some data or functionality from System 2. Instead of
directly accessing System 2's code, which could be complex and messy, System 1 can use System 2's API. 

This API acts like a middleman, providing a clear set of rules and commands that System 1 can use to communicate with 
System 2.

## Why use APIs
APIs have become incredibly popular for interfacing with tech systems for several reasons:
1) **Standardisation**: APIs provide a way for different software components to communicate with each other with clear rules and protocols, APIs make integration between systems easier and more predictable.

2) **Flexibility**: APIs allow developers to build modular systems. Instead of tightly coupling different components together, APIs enable us to loosely couple them, making it easier to update, replace, or scale components without affecting the entire system.

3) **Reuse**: APIs make code reusable. Developers can leverage existing APIs provided by third-party services or internal systems, saving time and effort, as well as ensuring consistency and reliability across different parts of the application.

4) **Ecosystems**: APIs foster vibrant ecosystems of developers and third-party services. Companies often expose APIs to allow others to extend the functionality of their products or integrate them with other services. This leads to innovation, as developers can combine different APIs to create new and powerful applications that were not possible before.

5) **Scalability**: APIs allow us to make more scalable systems. Systems can handle increased loads more efficiently thanks to APIs supporting features like caching and rate limiting to manage traffic spikes.

6) **Cross-platform compatibility**: APIs enable interoperability between different platforms and technologies. Be it web, mobile, desktop, or IoT devices, APIs provide a common interface that allows applications to interact with each other seamlessly.
